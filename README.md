# Multiphase Flow Pressure Drop Calculator

## Description:
A MATLAB code is used to calculate the pressure drops in oil & gas wells with multiphase flows using the Beggs & Brill method.

## What I Learned:
* MATLAB functions input, fprintf
* While loops, If loops
* Finding correlations for complex parameters
